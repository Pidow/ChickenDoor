For this version i have used:

ATTiny167 Digispark Pro
RTC DS3231 (Real Time clock)
Relay for Servomotor
Servomotor MG995
Battery holder 4 battery 1,5 v (x2)
Oled screen 128x64 I2C SPI serial.
SAMIORE ROBOT light sensor.

TARGET:
Move the chicken house doors 2 times per day.
Possible to connect the Oled screen sometimes to have information.
Estimate battery lifetime: 8 month with 2400mA battery.

How it's work:
Push software to Digispark.
If the RTC have power lost, software update it automaticaly.
Oled screen & RTC use the same SDA and SCL connection to DIGISPARK.
RTC DS3231 allow to have Temp information.
Light sensor must be adjusted on chickenhouse.

NOTE: Software is release, test is done.
But mounting test awaiting parts delivery.

You can use an relay to avoid battery consuming to maintain the servomotor position.
Becarefull Servomotor have only 180Â° angle, i have create a 3D print wheel to open the door.
