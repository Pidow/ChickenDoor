For this version i have used:

ATTINY85 Digispark
RTC DS1307 (Real Time clock)
Relay for Servomotor
Servomotor MG995
Battery holder 4 battery 1,5 v (x2)
LED (to have some information)

TARGET:
Move the chicken house doors 2 times per day.
No screen to have max lifetime battery.
Estimate battery lifetime: 8 month with 460mA battery.

How it's work:
Push software to Digispark.
Led blink one time, to inform you when setup it's done.
Led will make a series of blinking, each blink is an hour. (ex 8 o'clock, 8 led blink)
Led will make a second series of blinking, each blink is an hour before next action. (ex: 2 blinks means that the doors will open or close in 2 hours)

I have put an relay to avoid battery consuming to maintain the servomotor position.
Becarefull Servomotor have only 180Â° angle, i have create a 3D print wheel to open the door.
